iPhilia-mobile-app
==================
iPhilia is a Catholic young adults community in Fremont California. iPhilia started in 2013 Fall, and our web project started in 2014 June. Our goal is to bound iPhilia members' relationship, also attract other young adults to join our community. We hope to deliver God's love to people regardless religions and nationalities through this little app. The features below will be built in the near future:

Young adults bible study schedule + RSVP
iDo service + RSVP
Submit personal prayer and view other people's prayers
As to the facts that many people do not understand the core values of Catholic in Taiwan, a lot of chuches are facing the difficulties to pass Catholic faith to the younger generations. In the long run, I hope this web project can be imported to Taiwan and sovle the issues.
